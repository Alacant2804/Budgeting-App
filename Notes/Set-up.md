# Configuration Process

1. In order to set up next.js project use this command:
   `npx create-next-app@latest . --typescript`

- . (dot): Specifies that the app should be created in the current directory (instead of a new folder).
- typescript flag to initialize the next.js app with TypeScript instead of JavaScript

2. Because of npm name restrictions project folder name cannot contain capital letters.
