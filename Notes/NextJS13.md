# Next.js 13

1. In the app directory (src/app), API routes should be placed directly under the api directory.
2. The name of the file should be route.ts. Technically name the file anything (like test.ts), it will not work as an API route. If you do so, Next.js won't recognize it as a route handler, and requests to that endpoint will result in a 404 error.This naming convention is important for several reasons:
   - **_Routing Mechanism:_** Next.js uses the route.ts file name to identify that this file contains the route handler logic. It automatically recognizes and routes requests to this file when you access the corresponding API endpoint.
   - **_Clarity:_** Using route.ts makes it clear to other developers (or your future self) that this file is specifically for handling a particular route. It follows a consistent pattern that improves code readability and organization.
